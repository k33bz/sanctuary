# Changelog

All notable changes to Sanctuary (formerly XP Vitality).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-05

### Changed — the Sanctuary Crystal is now a crafting chain, not a placed altar
The old placed-altar ritual (`SanctuaryRitual` — beacon + conduit + dragon egg + 2 sponge +
inventory reagents, fired by a block-place) is **retired**. The crystal is now made at a crafting
table through two **component-aware special recipes** plus a lava temper. The recipes are
`CustomRecipe` subclasses with registered `RecipeSerializer`s (the mechanism vanilla uses for
map-cloning / firework crafting) so `matches()` inspects stack *components* — a vanilla JSON recipe
would accept any player head, which is wrong. Results are computed server-side, so vanilla clients
craft everything unmodified.

- **New items** (textured player heads, profile-identified, anvil-proof — the `WildEssence`
  pattern): **Wild Membrane (Raw)** (`WildMembraneRaw`, fire-resistant via the vanilla
  `minecraft:damage_resistant` / `is_fire` component so it survives lava) and **Wild Membrane**
  (`WildMembrane`).
- **Raw Wild Membrane** (shapeless): 1 Wild Essence + 2 Phantom Membrane + 2 Sponge → Wild
  Membrane (Raw).
- **Lava temper** (server-side, no mixin, no furnace): a Raw Wild Membrane item entity resting in a
  `lava_cauldron` (strictly lava) is tempered after ~4s of bubbling into a Wild Membrane; the lava
  cauldron empties to a plain cauldron (`beaconLavaConsumed`, default true).
- **Sanctuary Crystal** (shapeless, full 3×3): 1 Wild Membrane + 1 Conduit + 1 Dragon Egg +
  3 Bottle o' Enchanting + 1 Ominous Bottle + 1 Rabbit's Foot + 1 Poisonous Potato → the unchanged
  Sanctuary Crystal. (The crystal item, its profile identity, and all anchor behavior are
  untouched.)

### Changed — Wild Essence drops simplified; crystal mob-drop removed
Wild Essence now drops only from **player-attributed** kills of a **Warden** (guaranteed,
`wardenEssenceChance` = 1.0) or the top scaling tier **Nightmare** (tier 4, `nightmareEssenceChance`
= 3%); nothing below Nightmare drops it. The old **Sanctuary Crystal mob-drop** (`crystalDropMinTier`
/ `crystalDropChance`, 3% from Ferocious+ kills) is **removed** — the crystal is craft-only now.

### Added — debug command backends for the bot harness
`/sanctuary membrane give raw|cooked` and `/sanctuary testcook <x> <y> <z>` (force-temper a raw
membrane over a lava cauldron), alongside the existing `/sanctuary crystal give` and
`/sanctuary essence give`.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — CRITICAL: graves no longer destroy your inventory
`Graves.capture()` cleared the dying player.s inventory and created the grave but never
assigned the captured items to `grave.items` — the items were orphaned and lost, and the grave
came up empty (you were told "Your belongings rest in a grave" but claiming it gave nothing).
Present since graves shipped. One-line fix: the captured items are now stored on the grave.
Deaths preserve your inventory as intended. (Caught by the multi-bot faction test harness.)

### Testing — expanded pure-logic unit coverage (no behavior change)
Extracted the game-independent time/string/int math still trapped in Minecraft-coupled classes
into standalone, testable helpers (same pattern as `SurvivalLogic`), then had the coupled classes
call the helpers. Pure refactor + tests — the jar behaves identically; each extraction is a
call-through verified to return exactly what the inline code did.

- **`grave/GraveLifecycle`** — the grave-timing predicates lifted out of `Graves`: `isPublic`,
  memorial-decay eligibility, and drift eligibility (millis + config-value in, boolean out).
- **`FeralEggNames`** — Feral Egg name/star-lore parsing lifted out of `FeralEgg`: `parseStars`,
  the star-glyph line detector, and the lore-line star counter.
- **`anchor/AnchorCapRules`** — the Warden-tier → anchor-cap progression lifted out of
  `PlayerProgress`: required-tier-for-next-raise and the bounded one-step raise decision.
- **`anchor/AnchorFuel`** — the fuel/upkeep math lifted out of `AnchorUpkeep` and
  `AnchorState.PlacedAnchor`: exempt/active/hours-left, the bank cap, fed-expiry, and accepted-item
  count.
- **`RespawnLedger`** — the remaining death-ledger update rule lifted out of `RespawnChoice`:
  decay (via `SurvivalLogic`) → milestone reset → accumulate the per-death surcharge.

32 new boundary-focused JUnit tests across `GraveLifecycleTest`, `FeralEggNamesTest`,
`AnchorCapRulesTest`, `AnchorFuelTest`, and `RespawnLedgerTest`.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added — The crafted sanctuary
A **build-it ritual** alternative to lucky Sanctuary Crystal drops, in the mod's established
ritual idiom (structure + trigger block + validity check + consumed components + dramatic
effect + spawned result). It feeds the existing anchor system — the result is a normal Sanctuary
Crystal, so both paths converge.

- **Wild Essence** — a new textured player head (a glowing ender-eye), anvil-proof by profile
  name exactly like the Sanctuary Crystal. A **ritual reagent**, not an anchor. Give with
  `/sanctuary essence give`.
- **Drops.** A **Warden** kill now *guarantees* 1 Wild Essence (pairs with the existing
  Warden→anchor-cap attunement — one fight, both rewards). Other hostiles drop it by a
  tier-scaled chance, tier 2+ (Savage+) only: `wildEssenceChanceSavage` / `Ferocious` /
  `Nightmare` (defaults **0.005 / 0.02 / 0.08**). Toggle `wildEssence`; disable all of it with
  the same toggle.
- **The ritual.** Place a **conduit on a beacon**, a **dragon egg on the conduit**, and **2
  sponges** within 2 blocks — while holding **1 Wild Essence + 2 phantom membranes** in your
  inventory. Placing the conduit *or* the capstone dragon egg fires the check. On success the
  beacon, conduit, dragon egg, and 2 sponges vanish, the reagents are consumed, a flash +
  end-rod + beacon/conduit sound plays, and you receive a **Sanctuary Crystal**. Missing a piece
  shows an actionbar hint and touches nothing.
- **Crafting-only servers.** The drop path stays (`crystalDropChance`); set `crystalDropChance=0`
  to make the ritual the **only** route to new sanctuaries.

New config: `wildEssenceEnabled`, `wildEssenceChanceSavage/Ferocious/Nightmare`
(live-tunable: `essence.chanceSavage` etc.). Docs: ANCHORS.md gains "Crafting a sanctuary";
MECHANICS.md gains Wild Essence, the ritual recipe, and the drop tables.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-07-04

### Added — Dialog input controls (26.x native)
The anchor, respawn, and Gravekeeper dialogs gain **text fields and pickers**, built on the
26.x server-dialog INPUT system (`net.minecraft.server.dialog.input.*`) — values submit into
permission-0 backend commands via `$(key)` template substitution. No client mod.

- **Name your sanctuary.** The anchor menu gains a *Name this sanctuary* button (owner or
  creative only) opening a text input (up to 24 chars). The name shows on the floating anchor
  label — above the fuzzy upkeep timer — and in `/sanctuary anchor list`. Backed by the new
  permission-0 `/sanctuaryrename` command, acting on the nearest owned anchor within 6 blocks.
  Section signs are stripped so names can't inject colour codes.
- **Choose where you wake.** A player who owns **two or more active sanctuaries** gets a
  single-option picker on the respawn dialog to choose which one to wake at (free — it just
  redirects the free respawn); the nearest-to-death is pre-selected as the default. Single-anchor
  players are unaffected. Backed by permission-0 `/sanctuarywake`.
- **Search the Gravekeeper's ledger.** When the keeper holds or can summon many estates, a
  *Search owner* text field + *Filter by owner* button re-opens his dialog filtered to matching
  owner names (case-insensitive substring), with a *Show all* reset. Backed by
  `/sanctuarygrave search`.

Feral-egg wager sliders (a `number_range` use) are **deferred** — see `SPEC.md`: they need a
betting/market mechanic that does not exist yet.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added — Graves & Graveyards (System 10)
Grave lifecycle events stream to `config/sanctuary_grave_logs/*.ndjson` (created / drifted /
held / claimed / summoned / decayed, with actor + `robbery:true` on non-owner claims), and two
new scoreboard objectives feed the stat boards and external dashboards: `sanct_graves` (made)
and `sanct_robbed` (robbed, credited to the robber). `/sanctuarydanger status|reset` (ops)
finally exists — reset re-zeroes the persisted world-age epoch, which dashboards can watch to
lap leaderboard seasons.
Death seals your inventory into a **grave** at the death site — JSON-backed (despawn/hopper
proof), headstone of block-display stone with your own shrunk head affixed on top, owner-only.
After `grave.driftHours` (24h real time) it **drifts** to the nearest sanctuary graveyard;
after `grave.publicHours` (48h) the label turns red and anyone may rob it. Looted stones crack.
Ops consecrate yards with `/sanctuarygraveyard set [radius]` — grid plots, plus the
**Gravekeeper**: a still cleric whose dialog summons your loot-bearing graves from the wild or
rival cemeteries (for a fee) — delivered by an **allay courier** that flies off, vanishes, and
returns to settle the stone into the next open plot. Claiming from a yard costs a small toll;
the free option is the walk. Plots are **1x3** -- headstone plus two open blocks fronting a
walkable lane, stones shoulder-to-shoulder (display slabs never connect). A **full yard makes
room**: oldest looted memorial cleared first; failing that the oldest unlooted grave enters the
**Gravekeeper's hold** -- off the lawn, loot intact, reclaimable via his menu with fees and the
48h public timer still applying. Overflow abuse is visual, never a broken mechanic.
**Wild** looted memorials crumble to ash after `grave.memorialDecayDays` (14 real days, 0 =
never); cemetery stones never decay — eviction is the yard's only groundskeeper. Unlooted
wild graves stand where they fell (public after 48h) and drift to the nearest graveyard only
after `grave.driftHours` (default 21 days). Loot never decays.
**Survival consecration ritual**: no command needed — inside your own sanctuary, fence a pen
(9x9 up to 81x81, gate allowed), build an iron-golem body and crown it with a skeleton or
wither skeleton skull. The effigy is consumed and the Gravekeeper rises — wandering his
grounds freely, never past the fence. One graveyard per sanctuary, owner-bound.

### Added — Native [AFK] tag
Idle players (no movement or camera turn for `afk.minutes`, default 5) get a gray **[AFK]**
prefix in the tab list and a quiet chat notice; any input clears it. No scoreboard teams
touched, so it stacks cleanly with the bundled *name colors* pack — the reason VT's own afk
display pack couldn't be used. Toggle `afkTag`.

### Added — Mob-griefing refinements
- **Creeper terrain mercy** (`creeperTerrainProtection`, on): creeper blasts hurt entities at
  full strength, but the only blocks that ever break are **player-placed doors and their
  threshold** (`frameRadius`) — same registry as frame smashing. The world never craters;
  your doorstep still breaches. TNT/ghasts/beds/crystals untouched.
- **Endermen clone, don't steal** (`endermanCloneNotSteal`, on): the world keeps its block;
  the enderman carries away a copy (worst case it plants a stray mundane block later).
  Both replace the blunt VT anti-grief packs with siege-aware versions — the VT packs remain
  bundled for servers that want total protection instead.

### Added — Stat boards (holographic leaderboards)
`/sanctuaryboard add <objective> [title]` (ops) mounts a fixed text-display leaderboard facing
you — top 10 of ANY scoreboard objective, refreshed every 5s, persisted across restarts
(`/sanctuaryboard remove` deletes the nearest). Pairs with the bundled VT stat packs: enable
`track_raw_statistics` and any vanilla stat becomes wall art. Sanctuary maintains its own
objectives: `sanct_hatched` (destined chicks hatched), `sanct_gen_best` (deepest bloodline
generation — the server's breeding crown), `sanct_toll` (levels paid to the death toll).

### Added — Respawn choice: your soul settles (System 9)
Death sends you to the **nearest active sanctuary, free** — then a native dialog offers paid
upgrades: **return to bed** (5% of the level you died with) or **resurrect where you fell**
(15% — the corpse-run skip). No sanctuary anywhere? Vanilla's spot stands and only resurrect
is offered. Costs come on top of normal soul retention; the free option never charges, so a
bad streak can't spiral you to zero.

**The death toll**: every death raises your personal surcharge (+25% of the base price,
configurable). It decays with time *played* (default 1% per 10 minutes — the PLAY_TIME stat,
so it can't be waited out offline) and **clears completely when you reach a new XP milestone**.
Config: `respawnChoice` toggle, `respawn.bedCost` / `respawn.backCost` /
`respawn.escalationPerDeath` / `respawn.escalationDecayPer10Min` / `respawn.minCostLevels`.
Ledger persists in `config/sanctuary_deaths.json`. Vanilla clients get the full dialog —
same 26.x server-dialog system as the anchor menu.

### Added — Bundled Vanilla Tweaks (all opt-in)
59 [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) datapacks + crafting tweaks now ship inside the
jar as built-in datapacks — **all disabled by default**, enabled individually and per world with
vanilla `/datapack enable "sanctuary:vt/<name>"` (list them with `/datapack list available`).
No separate downloads, no extra jars to keep updated.

Datapacks: anti creeper/enderman grief, armor statues, coordinates hud, double shulker shells,
dragon drops, fast leaf decay, more mob heads, multiplayer sleep, player head drops, silence
mobs, xp bottling, track statistics + track raw statistics (all vanilla stats as scoreboards). Crafting tweaks: back to blocks, craftable gravel, double slabs, dropper to
dispenser, universal dyeing, unpackable ice.

Notable synergies: **dragon drops** makes the dragon egg renewable (each respawned dragon drops
one), and **xp bottling** lets veterans bottle their life force — both deliberate fits for the
sanctuary economy. Attribution in `credits.txt`; bundled per the Vanilla Tweaks terms.

### Added — Feral Eggs (breed your way to Nightmare poultry)

Feature concept by **Zugzuggin'** — every Feral Egg carries the credit in its lore.

- **Contaminated clutches**: an egg appearing within a block of a living feral (rabid) hen
  becomes a **Feral Egg** at her tier — still a vanilla egg, always named plainly "Feral Egg";
  the tier lives in the name's *color* (Savage gold, Ferocious red, Nightmare dark red), which
  an anvil cannot forge. Grades stack separately and trade cleanly.
- **Star quality = generations**: every Feral Egg carries 0–5 stars as a gold line atop its
  tooltip — the bloodline's depth. A wild-turned hen lays 0★; each destined generation lays one star deeper
  (cap 5★). The hen herself never shows stars — the lineage hides in her blood (an invisible
  tag) and only reveals itself on her eggs.
- **The hatch gamble** (odds by stars — normal chick / tier down / same / tier up):
  0★ 90/–/9/1 · 1★ 75/5/19/1 · 2★ 66/8/24/2 · 3★ 50/10/35/5 · 4★ 33/10/47/10 ·
  5★ 25/10/45/20, clamped Savage..Nightmare. Most eggs hatch ordinary chickens — five lucky
  generations stand between a wild Savage hen and true 5★ Nightmare stock.
- **The turn**: a destined bird goes feral the moment it loads as an adult — anywhere, no zone
  or chance roll (the gamble already happened). Sanctuaries still pacify it while it stands
  inside (the revert holds); the destiny survives, and the wilds wake it again. Turned animals all read **Feral <name>** — color alone tells the tier. Arena fights,
  wilderness ambushes, and gift-wrapped livestock are all now on the table.
- **Frontier ranching (by design)**: a pacified bloodline hen inside a sanctuary lays *plain*
  eggs — starred eggs only come from a hen that is actively feral, which only happens outside
  sanctuary ground. Store your prize stock safely at home; to harvest, run a coop in the wilds
  and defend it. Sanctuaries are literally that — safe. Risk is the price of Nightmare poultry.
- **Feral eggs smolder**: a dropped feral egg emits a subtle red dust mote — still a plain
  vanilla egg item, the aura sells it.
- Config: `feralEggsEnabled` under `mobscaling`; the star table lives in code.
- No new mixins — laying, hatching, and turning all ride the existing entity-load hooks, so the
  feature is identical on every supported Minecraft version.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-07-03

First multi-version release: jars for **Minecraft 26.2** (`main`) and **26.1.x** (branch
`26.1`), named `sanctuary-0.5.1+<mcversion>.jar`.

### Added
- **Native-dialog anchor menu** alongside the sgui furnace menu (A/B), with polish pass:
  text-first dialog, Owner label, compact 8-char anchor id.
- **Per-anchor UUIDs**: precise admin targeting and a filterable
  `/sanctuary anchor list [selector]` (full/8-char id, owner name, `wild*cards`).
- **Admin anchor time commands**: `/sanctuary anchor time add|set <hours> [selector]` —
  nearest anchor by default, or every anchor matching the selector.

### Changed
- Two-line anchor label: name over timer.
- Init log reports the actual running Minecraft version; the Warden anchor-cap check is
  version-stable (`instanceof`) so the same source compiles on 26.1.x and 26.2.

### 26.2 port notes
- Pins: fabric-api 0.154.0+26.2, sgui 2.1.0+26.2. **Flan integration is inert on 26.2**
  (no Flan build published yet; it activates automatically once Flan ports, no update needed).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-02

### Renamed
- **xpvitality → Sanctuary** (`com.k33bz.sanctuary`, `/sanctuary`, `config/sanctuary.json`).

### Anchors reimagined
- **Sanctuary Crystal replaces beacon + dragon egg**: a textured player head IS the anchor.
  Drops from tier-3+ (Ferocious+) mobs killed by players (3%); place to raise a sanctuary,
  break to recover it. `/sanctuary crystal give` for admins.
- **Upkeep & decay**: fresh crystals carry 24 h; emeralds add 2.5 h, emerald **blocks 24 h
  (1 block = 1 day, ~6.7% more efficient than loose)**, bank cap 1536 h (= one stack of
  blocks). Dry anchors go **dormant** (no safety, claim released, raidable) and only a
  **dragon egg** (+7 days) rekindles them. Decay runs on real server time — offline players'
  anchors need banked fuel, and ANY player may refuel.
- **Visual state language**: spinning shell = alive, still = dormant, campfire smoke = final
  24 h; label "Sanctuary Anchor (fuzzy timer)" in purple (heats to red), gold for eternal.
- **Furnace-style menu** (empty-hand click): fuel input (left = stack, right = one), live
  per-second countdown with owner + UUID, flame gauge = banked fraction.
- **Anchor cap progression**: start at 1; Warden kills of rising tiers raise it (any → 2,
  Feral+ → 3, … Nightmare), max 3 unless admins `/sanctuary cap set`. Min spacing 192 blocks.
- **Flan integration** (soft dep): active anchors auto-carry an admin claim (r16); released on
  dormancy/break. **fabric-permissions-api** bundled: `sanctuary.anchor.create/break/admin`.
- **Spawn suppression**: no natural hostile spawns inside active sanctuaries.
- **Sanctuary revert**: buffed mobs (and their scaled XP) revert to vanilla inside safe zones.

### World & combat
- **Dimension gating**: scaling/anchors Overworld-only (`scalingDimensions`); Nether/End vanilla.
- **Danger rebalance**: `perDayWeight` 0.02→0.0005 (was capping in ~2.5 real days),
  `perBlockWeight` →0 (double-dipped with mob attributes); `/sanctuary danger status|reset`
  re-zeroes the age pressure via a persisted epoch.
- **Enemy-wide scaling**: slimes, phantoms, ghasts now scale (were Monster-gated).
- **Indirect damage scaled**: projectiles/explosions from buffed mobs (arrows, creepers, ghast
  fireballs) now carry the attacker's multiplier; PvP excluded from world-danger scaling.
- **Fuzzy zone edges** (σ=12% per spawn) and an optional `damageCurveExponent` (damage+XP).
- **Hunters** (follow-range up to 3×), **door-breakers** (any difficulty past 1000 blocks,
  distance-scaled chance), **frame smashing** (soft blocks around player-placed doors when the
  path is blocked), **rabid wildlife** (25% of Savage+ animals hunt players).
- **Threat readout**: boundary + login actionbar messages with a personalized 5-skull scale.
- **Soul retention**: death keeps 30% of levels +5%/milestone (cap 80%) — veterans lose
  proportionally less. Vanilla recovery orb unchanged.

### Observability
- **Spawn-source tags** (invisible) on every mob; **kill-metrics ledger** (64-block cells,
  `/sanctuary metrics top`) and **NDJSON kill event log** (per-day files, SQLite-convertible).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-01 (in progress)
### Added
- **System 7 — spawn-based wild-mob difficulty.** When a hostile spawns, it's buffed by its distance
  from the nearest sanctuary anchor: health/damage/speed scale up (`mobscaling.*PerBlock`, capped at
  `mobscaling.maxMultiplier`, default 8×). Buffs are **permanent attribute modifiers baked into the mob's
  NBT** at spawn — so a wildlands monster stays strong even if it chases a player into a safe zone.
  Mobs inside a safe zone stay vanilla-strength.
- **Tiered threat names + particles**: buffed mobs get a coloured title by tier
  (Feral → Savage → Ferocious → Nightmare) and emit an escalating particle aura near players
  (smoke → angry → flame → soul-fire). Config: `mobscaling.*` knobs + toggle `mobscaling`.
- Verified live via console: a zombie at 2000 blocks = 76 HP "Savage Zombie", at 8000 = 160 HP (capped)
  "Nightmare Zombie", at spawn = vanilla 20 HP.
- **Sanctuary anchor = beacon + seated dragon egg** — right-click a real vanilla beacon while holding a
  dragon egg to seat the egg inside it and form a safe anchor (protects a 128-block region; wildlands stay
  lethal). The egg shows as a **shrunk `block_display`** floating in the beacon (`anchor.eggScale`/
  `anchor.eggHeight`, live-tunable). Anchor beacons suppress the vanilla beacon UI; breaking the beacon
  pops the egg back out and deactivates. Persists in `config/xpvitality_anchors.json`. Both the
  world-danger mixin and wild-mob spawn scaling use the nearest of config + placed anchors.
  **All vanilla blocks/entities → renders natively on every client (vanilla or modded), no custom content.**
- **Wild-mob XP reward** — deeper mobs drop proportionally more XP (`mobscaling.xpPerBlock`, cap
  `mobscaling.xpMax`, default 20×), via an access-widened `Mob.xpReward` set at spawn. Braving the death
  zone is a high-risk XP goldmine (and XP is the mod's survivability currency).
- **Balance:** linear frontier curve, damage **+1×/1000 blocks**. Split the single cap into
  independent caps — `damageMax` **60×** (deep wildlands one-shot fresh AND geared players),
  `speedMax` **1.4×** (fast but controllable), `healthMax` **12×**. The ≤~8k playable zone stays
  balanced (under the caps); beyond it becomes a true death zone. Verified: a Nightmare mob at
  (40000,40000) = ~172 damage, 1.4× speed, ~20× XP.

### Changed
- **Dropped Polymer.** The anchor was briefly a Polymer custom block/item, but Polymer's vanilla-disguise
  does not apply to clients that run Polymer themselves without this mod (they get raw magenta/missing-
  texture) — common on modpacks. The beacon+dragon-egg approach is bulletproof on all clients.

### Verified (server-side, via console)
- Beacon+egg → `Sanctuary anchor formed`; remove egg → `removed`; JSON updates correctly.
- Mob scaling, split caps, and XP reward all confirmed on summoned mobs at distance.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-30
### Added
- **Bonus max-health hearts** at level milestones (default 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, …) — one heart
  each, via a transient `max_health` attribute modifier. Vanilla clients render the extra hearts.
- **Absorption "XP shield"** (yellow hearts): `(level/milestone − 1) × maxHealth`, e.g. level 15 → 50%,
  level 40 → 60%, resetting each milestone. Clamped by `shieldMaxFraction`; topped up each interval.
- **Underwater breath** (System 6): the `OXYGEN_BONUS` attribute scaled by level (`oxygen.perLevel`,
  cap `oxygen.max`) — air lasts ~`(bonus+1)×15s`, so a level-500 player is ~2 hours (effectively can't drown).
- **Shield out-of-combat cooldown**: the shield only refills after you've been clear of damage for
  `max(shield.cooldownMin, shield.cooldownBase − milestones × shield.cooldownPerMilestone)` seconds
  (default 10s, −1s/milestone) — so it no longer regenerates mid-fight.
- New config + `/xpvitality` knobs: `armor.perLevel`, `armor.max`, `hearts.hpPerMilestone`,
  `shield.maxFraction`, `oxygen.perLevel`, `oxygen.max`, `shield.cooldown{Base,PerMilestone,Min}`,
  and toggles `armor`, `hearts`, `shield`, `breath`.

### Changed
- **Damage mitigation is now real vanilla armor** (`armor.perLevel`, capped at `armor.max`), shown as
  armor icons. Replaces the flat "%-per-level" mixin math; the world-danger mixin still scales damage up
  first, so vanilla armor reduces afterward. Removed `mitigation.*` config keys.
- **Faster emergency heal**: `regenHealPerInterval` 1.0 → 2.0 (~1 heart/sec while hurt and holding XP).
- Player tick loop now refreshes attributes/shield every interval regardless of whether regen is enabled,
  and tracks a per-player last-damage time (via the damage mixin) for the shield cooldown.

### Fixed
- **Shield no longer refills mid-combat.** Vanilla deletes the absorption effect the instant it hits 0,
  which the code mistook for a first-time grant and re-applied immediately. Refills are now strictly gated
  by the out-of-combat cooldown; a depleted shield stays gone until you break contact. (Verified live via
  server-console telemetry.)

### Verified
- Compiles and unit-tested against real 26.1.2 jars; all attribute/effect API symbols confirmed via `javap`
  (note: the class is `net.minecraft.resources.Identifier`, not `ResourceLocation`, in un-obfuscated 26.x).
- Runtime-verified on a live 26.1.2 client: hearts, armor icons, shield + cooldown, breath, and the
  full damage cascade (shield → lethal save) all confirmed via server-side entity-data sampling.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-30
### Added
- **In-game config commands** (`/xpvitality`, op / level 2+): `list`, `get`, `set`, `toggle`,
  `save`, `reload`, and `anchor list|add|clear`. Changes apply live (the tick handler and damage
  mixin read config fresh each tick/hit); `save` persists to the json, `reload` reads it back.
- All command handlers wrapped so failures log a full stack trace instead of a bare dispatcher message.

### Verified
- Runtime-tested on a real 26.1.2 dedicated server: `set mitigation.max 0.55` applied instantly,
  `toggle danger` disabled the system live, and `save` persisted both to `config/xpvitality.json`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-29
### Added
- **System 4 — world-danger damage scaling**: mob damage scales with world difficulty, world age, and
  distance from configurable safe anchors; out-paces mitigation so high-level players still face rising pressure.
- Folded world scaling into `LivingEntityDamageMixin` ahead of mitigation (no new hook).

### Changed
- Spec bumped to four systems.

### Verified
- Compiles and tests green against real Minecraft 26.1.2 jars (Loom 1.17.13, Loader 0.19.3,
  Fabric API 0.153.0+26.1.2, Java 25). All `VERIFY` placeholders from the original draft resolved against
  the actual un-obfuscated symbols.

### Known / parked for 0.3.0
- Lethal save scales on hit magnitude, not true overkill-beyond-remaining-HP.
- Danger anchors are a manual config list; no village/structure auto-detection yet.

## [0.1.0] — initial design
- System 1 (passive regen), System 2 (level mitigation), System 3 (XP-funded lethal save).
- Server-authoritative; vanilla clients can connect.
