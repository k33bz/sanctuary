# Sanctuary Anchors — carving out civilization

A sanctuary is a safe circle: no scaling, no natural hostile spawns, buffed intruders revert
to vanilla. The world ships with one at spawn; every other one is player-made.

## How to raise one

1. Gather **Wild Essence** from the frontier and **craft** a **Sanctuary Crystal** through the
   chain below. (As of 0.8.0 there is no crystal mob-drop — the crystal is craft-only.)
2. Place it. That's the anchor — a spinning crystal head protecting r128.
3. Breaking it drops the crystal back.

## Crafting a sanctuary

The crystal is built through two **special crafting recipes** (component-aware `CustomRecipe`s, so
the textured reagent heads are matched by identity, not just item id) plus a lava temper. All
server-side — vanilla clients craft it unmodified.

**The raw material — Wild Essence.** A glowing ender-eye head dropped by **player-attributed**
kills: a **Warden always yields one** (`wardenEssenceChance` = 1.0); the top scaling tier
**Nightmare** (tier 4) drops it at `nightmareEssenceChance` = 3%; nothing below Nightmare drops it.
It is a reagent only — placing it does nothing.

**The chain:**

1. **Craft Raw Wild Membrane** — shapeless: **1 Wild Essence + 2 Phantom Membrane + 2 Sponge**
   (dry or wet), nothing else → **Wild Membrane (Raw)**. It is fire-resistant so it survives lava.
2. **Temper it** — drop the Raw Wild Membrane into a **cauldron of lava** (strictly lava). After a
   few seconds of bubbling the raw item is consumed, the **lava cauldron empties to a plain
   cauldron**, and a finished **Wild Membrane** pops out.
3. **Craft the crystal** — shapeless, full 3×3 (9 items): **1 Wild Membrane + 1 Conduit +
   1 Dragon Egg + 3 Bottle o' Enchanting + 1 Ominous Bottle + 1 Rabbit's Foot + 1 Poisonous
   Potato** → the **Sanctuary Crystal**.

## Anchor cap — Warden attunement

Everyone starts able to bind **1** sanctuary. Each additional binding demands a Warden kill of
rising tier: any Warden → 2, Feral+ → 3, up to Nightmare (config caps at 3 unless admins
bless more). A Warden kill also **guarantees** rare drops where lesser mobs only roll chances.

## Upkeep — sanctuaries burn fuel

| Fuel | Time |
|---|---|
| Fresh crystal | 24 h |
| Emerald | +2.5 h |
| Emerald block | +24 h (the efficient rate) |
| Dragon egg | +7 days, and the only way to rekindle a **dormant** anchor |

Clock runs on **real time**, online or not; bank cap 1536 h. Empty anchors go dormant: shell
stops spinning, safety ends, the Flan claim releases, the region is raidable. Click the
crystal empty-handed for the fuel menu (dialog or furnace-style, config). Admin anchors are
eternal and gold-labeled.

## Naming a sanctuary

Open the anchor's dialog menu (click the crystal empty-handed) and press **Name this
sanctuary** — a text input takes up to 24 characters. Only the anchor's **owner** (or a creative
admin) sees the button and may rename. The name replaces "Sanctuary Anchor" on the floating
label (the fuzzy upkeep timer stays on the line below) and appears in `/sanctuary anchor list`.
Naming is free and can be changed or cleared (submit blank) any time. Backed by the
permission-0 `/sanctuaryrename` command.

When you die owning **two or more active sanctuaries**, the respawn dialog offers a picker to
choose which one to wake at (free); the nearest to where you fell is the default. See
[DEATH-AND-GRAVES.md](DEATH-AND-GRAVES.md).

## Integrations

- **Flan**: active anchors auto-carry an admin grief-protection claim; released on dormancy.
- **Permissions**: `sanctuary.anchor.create / .break / .admin` via fabric-permissions-api —
  LuckPerms-ready, safe defaults without it.
- **Renewable dragon eggs**: enable the bundled `dragon drops` VT pack
  ([server guide](SERVER-GUIDE.md)) so every respawned dragon drops one.

Spacing: 192 blocks minimum between anchors. Overworld only by default.
